# Brain_Tumor_Detection
This project focuses on brain tumor detection using deep learning techniques. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify MRI brain scans into tumor and non-tumor categories. The model is trained and evaluated in Google Colab for ease of access and computational efficiency.

## 📁Dataset:

The dataset consists of MRI images of brain scans categorized into tumor and non-tumor classes.

The dataset is preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to improve model performance.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle or other public sources.

#  🧰 Tech Stack:

Python

Google Colab

TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning Framework)

OpenCV (Image Processing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)
